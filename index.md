# School Failsafe
### Turn school emails into one-tap calendar items — via SMS.

**School Failsafe** is a privacy-light service for busy parents. Forward school emails to your private address and get a **single SMS per action** with a **one-tap “Add to Calendar”** link (Google, Apple, Outlook, or .ics). Works great **without** the DoLife app; if you install DoLife later, the same actions flow into the app automatically.

- **Forwarding-only.** No inbox access or teacher CC required.
- **SMS first.** Clear, concise texts—no apps required.
- **One-tap calendar add.** Prefilled for your chosen calendar.
- **Privacy-light.** Raw emails deleted after processing.
- **Fast setup.** Finish in ~5 minutes.

## Who it’s for
Parents and caregivers who receive too many school emails—newsletters, teacher notes, game schedules, permission slips—and just need **the actionable bits** on a calendar.

## What you’ll receive
- **1 SMS per action** (not per email): a concise title, date/time (or due date), child & school name, plus a **one-tap Add to Calendar** link.
- **Daily recap (optional)**: a single email listing open actions & dates.
- **No duplicates**: updates and retractions sync to the same event.

## Why it’s different
- **Privacy-light by design**: we only process what *you* forward, redact before AI, delete raw email, and retain just the structured action (what/when/who) with a short redacted snippet for audit.
- **Calendar-native**: actions are created with your provider’s native flows (Google, Apple, Outlook), or via standards-compliant `.ics`.

## Works with your calendar
- **Google Calendar** → prefilled event on calendar.google.com  
- **Apple (iOS)** → direct `.ics` that opens Calendar  
- **Outlook (consumer/365)** → deeplink with `.ics` fallback  
- **Anything else** → `.ics` download
