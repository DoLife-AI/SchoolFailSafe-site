## FAQ

**What counts as an “email”?**  
Any message your forwarding rule sends to your private family address (whether it produces one or multiple actions). We try to avoid duplicates.

**What happens at the limit?**  
We’ll continue processing if you’ve enabled the overage add-on. Otherwise, we’ll pause new actions and notify you with steps to resume.

**Do you offer family sharing?**  
Multiple caregivers can receive SMS and share the calendar; actions are scoped per family account.

**Refunds?**  
We don’t currently offer prorated refunds, but you can turn off renewal at any time via the **Customer Portal**.

**Non-profits / schools?**  
Contact **support@dolife-ai.com** for options.
